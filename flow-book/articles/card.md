Although the flow methodology could be used for any recipe. The real power is when you use it with physical cards. A cards is a stand alone recipe which could be combined with others. In essence a card is the same as a regular flow recipe region. However a card could be easily moved so that you could place them above each other. 

### timeline

A card has an additional timeline in contrast with a normal flow region. The timeline indicates the time you are actively woking on a recipe. Most of the time you could do other activities. This timeline will show this. The timeline is placed on the top and bottom of the card. This will let you place the cards above each other and enable you to combine them because you see directly if a another recipe will fit into another. In addition it shows you your oven temperatures if a recipe needs it. This will help you to plan your cooking economically, oven-wise. The timeline will show a interval of 5 minutes where the filled boxes meant activity.


|||||---------------||||||||------- 240 -------|||||

here is a typical timeline where. The first 5 minutes you are actively working on the recipe, the next 15 minutes you are waiting for something. e.g. boiling. Than an activity of 10 minutes followed by a non activity. In this case the dish is in the oven at a temperature of 240 degree celsius. The last 5 minutes are an activity again. 

### format

To efficiently work together, the card need to conform to a standard format. The easiest format for this is a regular postcard. i.e. 105x148mm

### addition

To provide background information about a recipe, for example how long you could keep it in the freezer, an additional section could be used in the card to provide this.
