flow is meant to use as stand alone or integrated into for example a book, magazine, blog, etc. The region sets the boundaries where it start and where it ands. A magazine could have some background information about the recipe but inside a specific region only the conventions for flow are used. 

As standalone, cards could be used which has some extra benefits. See flow cards for more information.

A region is a rectangle with rounded corners. On the upper left the title of the recipe is placed. In the center a flowchart with the flow of the recipe. On cards an extra time marker is added on the top and bottom.
